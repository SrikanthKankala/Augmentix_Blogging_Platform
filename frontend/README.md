# Blogging Platform

This is a blogging platform application built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend. The application allows users to create, edit, and delete blog posts. It uses MongoDB Atlas for database storage.




## Features

- Create new blog posts
- Edit existing blog posts
- Delete blog posts
- View a list of all blog posts with creation dates


## Technologies

- **Frontend:** React, React Router, CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
- **Additional:** Axios for HTTP requests, React Icons for UI components

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
- MongoDB Atlas account and connection details.


 **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following lines:

    ```plaintext
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://kankalasrikanth1:QqUP8M61fJDuv1Ya@cluster0.mongodb.net/Blog_posts?retryWrites=true&w=majority
PORT=5001
    ```

My MongoDB Atlas Username: kankalasrikanth1
My MongoDB Atlas Password: QqUP8M61fJDuv1Ya

Please Connect Every time  MongoDB Atlas Current IP Address

    Ensure to replace `mongodb+srv://kankalasrikanth1:QqUP8M61fJDuv1Ya@cluster0.mongodb.net/Blog_posts?retryWrites=true&w=majority` with your actual MongoDB Atlas connection string if it changes.



### Usage

- **Create a New Post:** Navigate to `/create` to add a new blog post.
- **Edit a Post:** Click on the "Edit" button next to a post to modify it.
- **Delete a Post:** Click on the "Delete" button next to a post to remove it.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
